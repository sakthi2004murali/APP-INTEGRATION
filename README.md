Project Title: Weather Fetcher – A Responsive Webpage with API Integration
Project Description

This project demonstrates a fundamental yet crucial real-world application of API integration within web development by creating a responsive webpage that dynamically fetches and displays weather data for any city entered by the user. It is developed using core web technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – without relying on external libraries or frameworks, showcasing clear understanding of client-side scripting, asynchronous data fetching, DOM manipulation, and responsive design principles.

The webpage consists of a clean and minimal interface with a title header “Weather Info”, a text input field for the user to enter a city name, a button to trigger the data fetching process, and a results section to display the fetched weather details. Upon entering a city and clicking the “Get Weather” button, the JavaScript getWeather() function is invoked. This function performs an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap public API, using the fetch method and an API key to retrieve the current weather information for the specified city.

The fetched data is processed in JSON format, where key details such as the city name, country code, temperature in Celsius, and the general weather description (for example, “clear sky”, “few clouds”, or “moderate rain”) are extracted from the API response and dynamically inserted into the HTML DOM to display the results on the webpage without reloading. In the case of invalid city names or failed requests, user-friendly error messages are displayed in red, enhancing the user experience by clearly indicating what went wrong.

The webpage is designed to be fully responsive using CSS media queries. On wider screens, the weather display container remains compact and centered, while on devices with a maximum width of 600px, the container adjusts to 90% width, ensuring it is accessible and readable on mobile devices as well. This design responsiveness guarantees usability across different screen sizes, which is an essential requirement in modern web applications to cater to users accessing via smartphones, tablets, or desktops.

Stylistically, the application uses a soft, professional theme with neutral background, white content boxes, rounded corners, and subtle box shadows to achieve a clean aesthetic. Inputs and buttons are styled for ease of use and visual consistency, maintaining sufficient spacing and intuitive user interaction.

The project showcases key learning outcomes including:

Understanding of RESTful API concepts and integrating them within frontend applications.

Writing clean asynchronous JavaScript code with async/await for better readability and error handling.

Effective DOM manipulation to update UI elements dynamically based on API responses.

Handling HTTP response errors gracefully to inform the user about incorrect inputs or server issues.

Developing a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and media queries, adhering to best design practices.

Managing API keys securely within frontend limitations (noting that in production, API requests would preferably be proxied via backend to protect keys).

This webpage is a foundational step for larger projects involving real-time data fetching, dashboards, or full-fledged weather applications with forecast features, maps, and historical data visualisations. Moreover, it can be extended further by integrating additional features such as:

Displaying icons representing weather conditions.

Allowing unit switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Fetching multi-day forecasts and rendering them in a card layout.

Integrating geolocation APIs to automatically fetch weather based on the user’s current location.

Using frameworks like React for component-based UI and improved state management.

The Weather Fetcher project submitted as part of the CodTech internship API integration task not only fulfills the technical deliverables by creating a responsive webpage with dynamically loaded data from a public API, but also reflects the importance of building practical, user-centric web applications. It demonstrates the developer’s ability to apply theoretical knowledge to create solutions addressing real-world needs, which is essential in any software development career.

This project reinforces confidence in integrating third-party services within web applications, an inevitable requirement in modern software development, and lays a strong foundation for upcoming internship projects or job roles involving frontend development, API integration, and dynamic user interfaces.
